    "The idea is to repeatedly randomly select data from the dataset (*with replacement*) and build a Decision Tree with each new sample. The default is to have the randomly selected data be the same size as the initial dataset. Note that since we are sampling with replacement, many data points will be repeated in the sample and many won't be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forests also limit each node of the Decision Tree to only consider splitting on a random subset of the features.\n",

    "    CreateRandomForest(data, num_trees, num_features):\n",
    "        Repeat num_trees times:\n",
    "            Create a random sample of the test data with replacement\n",
    "            Build a decision tree with that sample (only consider num_features features at each node)\n",
    "        Return the list of the decision trees created\n",
    "\n",
    "To classify a new document, use each tree to get a prediction. Choose the label that gets the most votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default parameters that sklearn uses, which are also standard defaults, are 10 trees and only considering sqrt(m) features (where m is the total number of features).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Out of Bag Error\n",
    "\n",
    "We can analyze a Random Forest using the standard cross validation method of splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing set. However, if we're clever, we notice that each tree doesn't see all of the training data, so we can use the skipped data to cross validate each tree individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll skip the mathematical proof, but when selecting from the dataset, about one third of the data is left out (discussed [here](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/203491/expected-coverage-after-sampling-with-replacement-k-times) if you want to think about the math). So every data point can be tested with about 1/3 of the trees. We calculate the percent of these that we get correct, and this is the *out-of-bag error*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proven that this is sufficient and that cross validation is not strictly necessary for a random forest, but we often still use it as that makes it easier to compare with other models.\n",
    "\n",

The idea is to compare the out-of-bag error of the trees with the out-of-bag error of the trees if you change the feature's value (basically, if we screw with the value of the feature, how much does that impact the total error?). Here is the pseudocode for calculating the feature importance for a single feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "        For every tree:\n",
    "            Take the data that is not covered by the tree.\n",

    "            Calculate the OOB error on the data with the feature values permuted.\n",

    "                feature importance on this tree.\n",
    "        Average all the individual feature importances to get the feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "sklearn uses a different method, described [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#feature-importance-evaluation). Their method doesn't involve using the out-of-bag score. Basically, the higher in the tree the feature is, the more important it is in determining the result of a data point. The expected fraction of data points that reach a node is used as an estimate of that feature's importance for that tree. Then average those values across all trees to get the feature's importance."

    "\n",
    "You will often hear the word \"Bagging\" dropped around the same time as \"Boosting.\" The two are very different techniques and not really used in the same context. You already know what bagging is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting, properly stated, the use of the output of one model as the input of another. Thus we can use Pipelines to construct whole groups of models that are technically \"boosted\" by each other. Any and all models can be boosted, according to the theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"boosting\" is most commonly used to describe boosting used with trees, and most particularly Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRTs). You can think of it as \"combining weak learners\" to make a \"strong learner\". This is mumbo-jumbo. The \"weak\" learners are just normal decision trees (as opposed to an estimator which is especially \"weak\" in some way). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Boosting in Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of boosting used in trees in common practice today. This is the most common jargon usage of this word in data science. If you hear fellow data scientists say \"boosting\", they are often referring to boosted trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding bias into the training process\n",
    "\n",
    " In the boosted tree algorithms, a \"family\" of trees is \"grown\" over successive generations of trees, by making each successor tree an expert on attacking the weaknesses of the other. What results is a single \"master\" tree designed to defeat all weaknesses of the training set selection. Members of the family are weighted by the ratio of errors not covered by the previous members. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of boosting (in any case) is based on measuring the degree to which a given tree fails in making a good prediction. This, of course, is the cost or more commonly in the case of trees \"loss\" function.\n",

    "Why? The intuition is that the algorithm ends up partitioning on the noise rather than the signal. What I think happens is that signal gets partitioned into a few relatively powerful trees (perhaps 1/5th to 1/3 of them), and most of the trees are set up to shunt out the noise. I suspect that the weights (lagrange multipliers) provide a degree of freedom so that probably reflects the dominance of that particular noise, not unlike an eigenvector/eigenvalue relationship.\n",
